# Application of an ANN for Sentiment Classification
The development of a Neural Network (NN) to predict the sentiment of user reviews on Steam, a video game digital distribution service, is described in this report. Sentiment analysis is a type of natural language processing that aims to categorize the sentiment of textual data. User reviews are subjective and will express a feeling about a game, which can be either negative or favourable. Steam can employ automatic sentiment analysis of user reviews to assign tags and organize reviews into categories for customers to peruse and gain a better knowledge of the games they're considering buying. We implement a simple baseline solution in the form of a Feed-Forward Neural Network that classified observations correctly more than half of the time. We then extend this by using an existing implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network, which we then tuned to produce a better classification rate. The resulting network produced a 3% better result with a significant improvement in sensitivity in comparison to the benchmark implementation we used. In comparison to the baseline model, the resulting network produced a 16% better classification rate with significant improvements in miss-rate and sensitivity. Uncontrollable factors imposed limitations on tuning, such as Google Colabâ€™s GPU usage limits.
